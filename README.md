Mitochondrial DNA content estimation from single cell sequencing

Low coverage whole genome sequencing has been developed in preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) for chromosome copy number variation analysis. This project is to estimate mitochondrial DNA content from single cell sequencing data.

Following purposes has been achieved:
Copy number profile visualization including mitochondrial deletion or duplication.
Accurate estimation of mitochondrial DNA content adjusted by genome size.
